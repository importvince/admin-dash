## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

1. How to use Grid in combination with Flex effectively
2. How to use minmax() to set column and row sizes
3. How to use auto-fit to set column sizes and make Grid flexible


### Continued development

This project was great practice for CSS Grid and ended up being pretty easy because I decided to try and match the example design. I think from here I'd like to continue practicing minmax() and auto-fit, since those seem to be the trickiest part. CSS can be frustrating on a small screen, so I did this one from my monitor. That'll be something I continue for design work.
